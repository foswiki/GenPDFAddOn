%SHORTDESCRIPTION%

This Add On to Foswiki adds a supplementary =view= script called =genpdf=.
=genpdf= generates a PDF document using the =htmldoc= tool from
http://www.htmldoc.org/. =genpdf= can generate a single topic, or a hierarchy
of topics. Configuration options can control page headers and footers, and
generation of cover pages.

See Sandbox.GenPDFAddOnDemo for a demonstration of some of the PDF
generation capabilities.

---++ Usage

   * The simplest way to activate PDF printing, is to add =genpdf= to front of the =SKIN= setting. This will replace the PatternSkin 'Print Version' on the lower action bar with 'Generate PDF' 
      * eg =Set SKIN=genpdf,pattern=   (add =?skin=genpdf,pattern= to the end of the URL to test)
   * A page can also be published by substituting =genpdf= for =view= in the topic URL.  (If using short URLs, insert =/bin/genpdf/= prior to the Web name).
   * To make it even easier for novice Foswiki users to use, you can add a link (like edit and attach) to =view.tmpl= to publish the current page (using the current topic as the document title). For example: <span class="WYSIWYG_TT"><br /></span> <verbatim><a href="%SCRIPTURLPATH%/genpdf%SCRIPTSUFFIX%/%WEB%/%TOPIC%?pdftitle=%TOPIC%">PDF</a></verbatim>
   * Another option is to create a global variable that inserts a PDF ICON in the document.  The following variable is expanded in the upper-right corner of this page. You can click it to get a PDF of this page.   If you set this in your Main.SitePreferences topic, it can be used in any topic.  
<verbatim>
   * Set GENPDFLINK=<span class="foswikiRight" style="margin:0 0 2em 5em; width:64px height:64px; text-align:center;">[[%SCRIPTURL{"genpdf"}%/%WEB%/%TOPIC%?%QUERYSTRING%][<img src="%PUBURL%/System/GenPDFAddOn/pdf-64.gif">]]</span>
</verbatim>
   * You may also choose to replace the Printable (?skin=print) targets in your favourite skin with
<verbatim>
[[%SCRIPTURL{genpdf}%/%WEB%/%TOPIC%][Printable]]
</verbatim>

---++ Configuring the Script

The script can be configured using URL parameters and/or web preference variables. URL parameters have precedence over web preference variables. If neither of these are present, the script will use hard-coded default variables. The general script configuration variables are explained in the next section while header/footer and title page configuration are explained in subsequent sections.
---+++ General Configuration

The following table shows the various configuration variables and their meaning. The first column gives the variable to use if passed in the URL. The second column shows the variable to use if using a Foswiki preference variable (i.e. Set VARIABLE = ). The third column gives the default value if neither the URL nor Foswiki preference variable is used. Note that URL variables have precedence over Foswiki preference variables.

If using Foswiki preference variables, copy them to the appropriate web preferences page. This plugin does not read settings from this topic!

%SEARCH{"\|\ [G]ENPDFADDON_" topic="%TOPIC%" type="regex" casesensitive="on" limit="21" nosearch="on" nosummary="on" header="   * Settings for the %SYSTEMWEB%.%TOPIC% Plugin" nototal="on" multiple="on" format="      * #Set $pattern(.*(G.*?N_.*? ).*) = "}%

---+++ Limiting the PDF Generation Region

The add-on allows the user to define the region of the topic that should be included in the PDF generation (much like the Foswiki %<nop>STARTINCLUDE% and %<nop>STOPINCLUDE% variables. In this case, HTML comments are used instead. Everything between these two comments will be included in the PDF generation. The rest of topic will be excluded.

   * Use =&lt;!-- PDFSTART --&gt;= to mark the starting point in the topic for PDF generation.
   * Use =&lt;!-- PDFSTOP --&gt;= to mark the stopping point in the topic for PDF generation.
Note that there can be multiple PDFSTART and PDFSTOP comment pairs in a single topic to selectively include/exclude multiple sections of the topic in the PDF document. (If you view this page in =raw= mode or edit it, you'll see an example of multiple PDFSTART/PDFSTOP sections to exclude the Foswiki table of contents). If no PDFSTART/PDFSTOP comment pair appears in the topic, the entire topic text is used. In general, this should not be a problem except for title topics that include forms as the form meta-data will show up in a fairly illegible manner at the end of the document. Therefore, for topics that reference forms, a PDFSTART comment should be placed at the beginning of the topic and a PDFSTOP should be placed at the end.

%T% __NOTE:__ all %META: tags are removed from the base topic. If you want to display form data, you should add %<nop>FORMFIELD{"field"}% tags to the topic or title topic.

---+++ Creating and Configuring a Title Page

The add-on allows the user to use a topic as a title page for PDF generation. Earlier versions of the add-on required that the title page be expressed using pure HTML as the title page topic was not Foswiki rendered. The latest version of add-on, however, does full Foswiki rendering of the title topic page like any other Foswiki topic. In addition, the following variables can be passed with the URL to override their settings elsewhere (e.g. in the web preferences or Foswiki preferences pages).

Also note that the PDFSTART and PDFSTOP HTML comments should be placed at the beginning and end of title topic. An example title page can be found at GenPDFExampleTitleTopic.
---+++ Creating and Configuring Headers and Footers

The add-on also allows the user to configure header and footer formats for both the main section of the document and the table of contents. Configuring the main header and footer is much like configuring a title page. You can select a Foswiki topic to use for the header and footer. Remember to wrap the HTML comments that HTMLDOC uses for the header and footer between &lt;!-- PDFSTART --&gt; and &lt;!-- PDFSTOP --&gt; tags. The add-on will perform Foswiki common variable substition within the HTMLDOC header/footer HTML comments. This will allow Foswiki variables (such as %<nop>REVINFO{web="%<nop>WEB%" topic="%<nop>BASETOPIC%"}%) to be embedded in the headers and footers.

See the HTMLDOC documentation at http://www.htmldoc.org for details of the format of the header and footers. In addition, the =genpdf= script will perform variable substition for the %<nop>GENPDFADDON _BANNER%, %<nop>GENPDFADDON _TITLE%, and %<nop>GENPDFADDON _SUBTITLE% variables as it does for the title page. Finally, the PDFSTART and PDFSTOP HTML comments should be placed at the beginning and end of header/footer topic. An example header/footer page can be found at GenPDFExampleHeaderFooterTopic.

Note that HTMLDOC will not generate a page header on any page generated by a Level 1 header (---+ header). This is a known issue in htmldoc through version 1.27. A patch is provided further on in this page.

---+++ Recursive rendering of topics

The add-on can search and recursively render all child topics of the requested topic in the same web.  Use the "More topic actions" -> "Set New Topic Parent" menu to establish or modify the parent/child relationships of topics. 
   * The default behavior is to render each topic as a separate chapter. A level 1 heading will be added as required to each topic.
   * If the =pdfheadershift= option is set to =auto=, then the first header in each topic will be set to the absolute depth of the child topic in the tree. In this case the PDF will consist of only a single chapter.
   * if it is desired to have other topics at the &lt;h1&gt; chapter level, any topic can be reset to the chapter heading 1 level by including the HTML comment on a new line, anywhere in the topic, ==&lt;!-- NEW CHAPTER --&gt;==
   * Child topics are not found across web boundarys.  
For example, if you create a !ParentTopic, then create !FirstChild and !SecondChild with !ParentTopic as their parent topic, then create !GrandChildOne with !FirstChild as its parent (and so on), you get a tree as shown below. In addition the PDF TOC layout is shown for the various headershift options:
| <nop> *Wiki Structure* | <nop> *Default Rendering* | ==pdfheadershift=auto== | ==pdfheadershift=auto== <br /> <small> ==&lt;!-- NEW CHAPTER --&gt;== </small> in !SecondChild |
| <verbatim>
ParentTopic
   - FirstChild
      - GrandChildOne
      - GrandChildTwo
   - SecondChild
      - GrandChildThree
</verbatim> | <verbatim>
1 ParentTopic
2 FirstChild
3 GrandChildOne
4 GrandChildTwo
5 SecondChild
6 GrandChildThree
</verbatim> | <verbatim>
1 ParentTopic
 1.1 FirstChild
  1.1.1 GrandChildOne
  1.1.2 GrandChildTwo
 1.2 SecondChild
  1.2.1 GrandChildThree
</verbatim> | <verbatim>
1 ParentTopic
 1.1 FirstChild
  1.1.1 GrandChildOne
  1.1.2 GrandChildTwo
2 SecondChild
 2.1 GrandChildThree
</verbatim> |
---+++ Generating PDF from a older revision of a topic.
The latest release of the GenPDFAddOn supports generating a PDF of a previous revision of a topic. Include the =rev=xx= parameter on the URL in the same format that you would view an older topic revision.
---++++!! Limitations
   * Specifying a topic revision will disable the recursive option.
   * The revision is __only__ applied to the primary topic. All other related topics - title pages, includes, attachments, etc. use the current revision.
   * Any in-topic settings =GEN<nop>PDFADDON_*= will be taken from the curent version and not from the requested topic revision.

---+++ PDF Logos 

The following Public Domain PDF Icons can be used to represent PDF files:

   * 32x32 Images <br />
     <img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/pdf-32.gif" alt="pdf-32.gif" width='32' height='32' /> pdf-32.gif <br />
     <img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/pdf-32.png" alt="pdf-32.png" width='32' height='32' /> pdf-32.png

   * 64x64 Images <br />
     <img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/pdf-64.gif" alt="pdf-64.gif" width='64' height='64' /> pdf-64.gif<br />
     <img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/pdf-64.png" alt="pdf-64.png" width='64' height='64' /> pdf-64.png 


---++ Frequently Asked Questions
   $ *How do I stop the table of contents from being generated?*: For some topics, like User topics, it doesn't make any sense to have a table of contents generated so add ='pdftoclevels=0'= as a URL parameter.
   $ *When I do a recursive PDF of !WebHome it doesn't include all topics*: That's because some topics distributed with !Foswiki don't have a parent association. If you _really_ want to include every topic in the web, you should reparent them all with !WebHome as the parent.
   $ *Ocassionally no PDF document is generated*: The default structure of =book= requires that headings be present in the topic. Try setting =pdfstruct=webpage=
---++ Add-On Installation Instructions

__Note:__ In order to view PDF files generated by this Add On, you will need to install a PDF viewer such as Adobe Acrobat in the user's browsers. The following instructions are for the administrator who installs the add-on on the server where Foswiki is running.

   * Install htmldoc from http://www.htmldoc.org/ (optionally use the patch in the Addon's zip file for headers on every page)
   * Access the =bin/configure= script - Extensions tab, click "Find Extensions", locate GenPDFAddOn in the table and click "Install"
   * In the =bin/configure= script, visit the GenPDFAddOn settings and set the path to the =htmldoc= command
   * _Windows Users:_ Edit the =bin/genpdf= script and update the "shebang" =#!/bin/perl= to match your system perl location <br /> 
      * Example: =#!C:\strawberry\perl\bin\perl.exe
   * %X% *Important* if you use Apache user authentication, be sure to add =genpdf= to the list of restricted scripts in the apache configuration.
   * %T% Copy any desired preferences from above and paste them into %USERSWEB%.SitePreferences, or the !WebPreferences topic for a single web.
   * Test if the installation was successful: 
      * Try loading [[%SCRIPTURL{genpdf}%/%WEB%/%TOPIC%][this page]] 
         * If you get a 404 - not found, make sure that a switchboard entry exists in LocalSite.cfg.
      * If it doesn't work, check your webserver logs for any problems. The most common issue is probably an htmldoc installation problem.
---+++ Alternative installation
   * Download the =tgz= or =zip= file and the =GenPDFAddOn_installer= file from the Add-on Home (see below)
   * Run the installer ( =perl GenPDFAddOn _installer= ) or unzip ==%TOPIC%.zip== in your Foswiki installation directory
   * Adjust the script ownership to match your webserver configuration (e.g. =chown nobody genpdf=) if needed.
   * Make sure the script is executable (e.g =chmod 755 genpdf=).
   * *Adjust the perl path in the genpdf script to match your perl installation location.*
   * Configure the =$Foswiki::cfg{Extensions}{GenPDFAddOn}{htmldocCmd} = "/path/to/htmldoc";= using =configure= (in the =Extensions= section) 
      * %X% You *must* visit and save the Foswiki configuration at least once after installation to set a hidden variable in the =LocalSite.cfg= file
      * See the _Configuration file settings_ below.
| *File:* | *Description:* |
%$MANIFEST%
---++ Configuration file settings
The following settings should be built automatically by bin/configure.

<verbatim>
$Foswiki::cfg{Extensions}{GenPDFPlugin}{htmldocCmd} = '/usr/bin/htmldoc';
$Foswiki::cfg{SwitchBoard}{genpdf} = {
          'function' => 'viewPDF',
          'context' => {
                         'view' => 1
                       },
          'package' => 'Foswiki::Contrib::GenPDF'
        };
</verbatim>

---++ Known Bugs
   * *Verbatim text runs off the page.* This is a limitation of HTMLDOC. Preformatted text may run off the edge of the page and be truncated.
   * *HTMLDOC crashes with segmentation faults.* Eg it fails to generate %SYSTEMWEB%.CompleteDocumentation. I managed to get it to work a few times, but it generally fails. The error returned is =Conversion failed: 'Inappropriate ioctl for device' at /var/www/Foswiki/lib/Foswiki/Contrib/GenPDF.pm line XXX=
   * *Some pages don't have a header.* HTMLDOC breaks the page for every level 1 heading (Eg. &lt;h1&gt;) but it doesn't write a header for the new page, so topics with lots of level 1 headings and not much content don't seem to have any headers. Therefore I patched htmldoc-1.8.24 to force a header for every new page:
